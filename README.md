# Terminal Battleship
Our project is an interactive, terminal-based interpretation of the classic 
boardgame 'Battleship'. It supports standard play mechanics such as placing 
ships, firing at your opponent, and sinking their fleet to achieve victory! 

The interface is completely within the terminal, where a character based 
representation of a battleship board, which can be played and interacted with by 
issuing "commands" to the terminal.
  
Standard visual I/O within the terminal is supported. If you have OCAML on your
machine, type make play to get started.
