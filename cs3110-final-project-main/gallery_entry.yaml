  Our project is an interactive, terminal-based interpretation of the classic 
  boardgame 'Battleship'. It supports standard play mechanics such as placing
  ships, firing at your opponent, and sinking their fleet to achieve victory!
  The interface is completely within the terminal, where a character based 
  representation of a battleship board, which can be played and interacted with
  by issuing "commands" to the terminal.
  
  Standard visual I/O within the terminal is supported.
